      I am a graphic designer currently working here in Misamis Oriental and a
      student of Kodego PH as Full Stack Web Dev. To be honest, years ago I once
      a student taking a course Civil Engineering in Cagayan de Oro College
      where I learn programmming. We have subject before called Computer
      Programming 101. I mastered any computer related subject but then I failed
      my Integral Calculus three times. So I decided to stop for the meantime to
      give my self break. A year later my interest in schooling is gone because
      I became practical that’s I started to work to help my family and to pay
      my debt of gratitude and the mess in my life. At first I enjoyed my work
      but few years later I am not happy anymore of my work. I know to my self
      that there is something missing in me. And I realize that this what I
      want, to develop something using codes. My goal right now is to finish
      this bootcamp so I can start working again and make my self stable for
      good.
