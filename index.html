    <h3>1993 - Present</h3>
    <p class="para_indent">
      The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since
      then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely
      used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official
      standard in December 1999. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML
      as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to
      create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today,
      including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS
      (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in
      a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across
      applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no
      surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called
      XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in
      2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules
      are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability
      between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the
      differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2. Most pages on the Web today
      were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years,
      the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been
      working on a brand new version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is
      still a draft specification, and is not yet an official standard. However,
      it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices,
      and is the way of the future. Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language
      taught in this course.

        The first “computer bug” was named that due to an actual bug. This bug
        was found by Grace Hopper. The computer she was building started to
        fail, that’s when she discovered an actual moth in the system. Since
        then, when something fails in either software or hardware, we call it a
        “bug”. If you want to read more about Grace Hopper’s history and legacy,
        take a look at this blog post we wrote a few weeks ago.

            There are around 700 separate programming languages. Amongst this
            list, some of the most popular languages are Javascript, Swift,
            Scala, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, Ruby, and C#, with millions of users
            utilizing them in both their careers and personal projects. However,
            new programming languages are constantly being created.
